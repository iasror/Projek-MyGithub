The policy is controversial both within and outside China because of the manner in which the policy has been implemented, and because of concerns about negative social consequences
possible cause behind China's gender imbalance
it had proved "remarkably effective
great success in helping to implement China's current economic growth
The reduction in the fertility rate and thus population growth has reduced the severity of problems that come with overpopulation
the focus of China on population control helps provide a better health service for women
The individual savings rate has increased since the one-child policy was introduced
less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, could have achieved the same results over an extended period of time
T]he policy itself is probably only partially responsible for the reduction in the total fertility rate
China could have expected a continued reduction in its fertility rate just from continued economic development, had it kept to the previous policy
The one-child policy is challenged in principle and in practice for violating a human right to determine the size of one's own family
leaves the older generations with increased chances of dependency on retirement funds or charity in order to receive support
If, for any reason, the single child is unable to care for their older adult relatives, the oldest generations would face a lack of resources and necessities
Some parents may over-indulge their only child
social problems and personality disorders in young people
The one-child limit is too extreme. It violates nature’s law
The social pressure exerted by the one-child policy has affected the rate at which parents abandon undesirable children
China's family planning programs contribute to infanticide
As a result of the policy, China successfully achieved its goal of a more stable and much-reduced fertility rate
rapid population growth as an obstacle to development
population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards
coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy
Rapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results
population control can involve measures that improve people's lives
a large increase in population would bring, "certain poverty on the citizenry
excessive growth may reduce output per worker
a larger population would mean more production
overpopulation has been blamed for a variety of issues, including increasing poverty
reduction of the population is a key to economic growth
economists doubt that a correlation between population reduction and economic growth exists
poverty and famine are caused by bad government and bad economic policies, not by overpopulation
higher population density leads to more specialization and technological innovation, which in turn leads to a higher standard of living
human beings are the ultimate resource
there is no correlation between population density and poverty and starvation
number of problems associated with overpopulation
The success of the policy has been questioned, and reduction in fertility has also been attributed to the modernization of China
The policy is controversial both within and outside of China
only children are spoiled
only children have aversive social skills
the lack of siblings has been blamed for a number of social ills
The one child policy has also been speculated to be the underlying cause of forced abortions
it is more difficult for only children to cooperate in a conventional family environment
only children are higher in achievement motivation
children with many siblings receive fewer resources
Only children are also more likely to make outside friends
